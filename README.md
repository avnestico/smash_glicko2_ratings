# smash_glicko2_ratings

## Python3 program for computing Glicko2 ratings of Super Smash Bros competitors

### Quick Setup

Run `python SmashRankingsCalculator.py` and watch the magic.

### How to use

When you download this repo, you'll see a file and two folders with the prefix "Melee". Depending on the game you're getting rankings for, this prefix could also be "SSB", "Brawl", "PM", or "Sm4sh".

`MeleeDates.txt`: A list of dates and tournaments.

    Paragon_2015
    
`MeleeUrls/`: A folder containing text files with bracket urls corresponding to the above. Liquipedia and Challonge brackets are supported.

    and so on...
    
`MeleeResults/`: A folder containing scraped matchups of the above tournaments. This is generated by the rest of the program, not inputted manually by you.

If you want to use this program for your own tournaments, replace the contents of `MeleeDates.txt` with your own tournaments the same way:

* tournaments in chronological order
* each tournament following the day it took place
* multiple tournaments in the same week not separated by a date

Then, create a file for each tournament in `MeleeUrls/`, matching the name written down in `MeleeDates.txt` with `.txt` added to the end of each, containing a list of the urls where brackets can be found for the tournament.

For other games, perform the same process: for Sm4sh, you would write `Sm4shDates.txt`, create files in `Sm4shUrls/`, and create an empty `Sm4shResults/` folder where the scraped results would be written to.

Then, run `python SmashRankingsCalculator.py --scrape` to process all game data.

### Program arguments

`--help`: Print a help message.

`--print-functions=[all|list]`: Print some useful functions with info on each of them, or just the list of functions. Only useful if you want to dig into the Python code.

`--scrape`: Use this argument if you wish to scrape all data, then process rankings.

`--scrape-tournament=<filename>`: Scrape any games found for a particular tournament. Useful if you're adding a new tournament to the data set and don't want to re-scrape everything else again.

`--format=[human|tab]`: Set to 'human' by default, this can be set to 'tab' to display rankings as a tab-separated list for easy copy-pasting.

`--game=[SSB|Melee|Brawl|PM|Sm4sh]`: Set this if you only wish to display the rankings for one game.

`--top_amount=<int>`: Set the number of players to display in rankings. Set to 100 by default.
